The **apps** module gathers scripts you can call as *entry-points* ( see the setup file). 

During the installation, *entry-points* are generated as executable files then  place into your python environement `Scripts`  folder. 

When you activate your python environement, all executables of the `Scripts`  folder are loaded as windows command and thus can call from the anaconda console
